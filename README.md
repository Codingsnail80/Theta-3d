# Theta-3d
A simple 3d graphics engine/renderer built in python

How to use:
To use this render you will need to install pygame (It is the backend used to make the renderer, so its essential to install this before use otherwie it will not work)

# Commands for insatlling pygame

These instructions assume you already know how to interact with the terminal and python on  your system. If you don't then I would recomend researching this before continuing.

## Windows:
pip insatll pygame

## MacOS:
pip3 install pygame

You may need to use "sudo" at the begining of your command if you are having trouble.

## Linux:

Make sure you have pip enabled on your system first.

pip insatll pygame

Or in some cases: sudo apt install python3-pygame

# Demo instructions
The demo allows for movment with WASD and camera movement with the arrow keys.

IMPORTANT: Make sure the demo file is in the same directory (folder) as the theta3d file.
