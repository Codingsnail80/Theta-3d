How to use:
To use this render you will need to install pygame (It is the backend used to make the renderer, so its essential to install this before use otherwie it will not work)

# Commands For Insatlling Pygame

These instructions assume you already know how to interact with the terminal and python on  your system. If you don't then I would recomend researching this before continuing.

## Windows:
pip insatll pygame

## MacOS:
pip3 install pygame

You may need to use "sudo" at the begining of your command if you are having trouble.

## Linux:

Make sure you have pip enabled on your system first.

pip insatll pygame

Or in some cases: sudo apt install python3-pygame

# Demo Instructions
The demo allows for movment with WASD and camera movement with the arrow keys.

IMPORTANT: Make sure the demo file is in the same directory (folder) as the theta3d file.


# Future Improvements

Currently it doesnt support textures however that is a planned additon to the render. You cannot directly load an objectc file either however this is also a planned feature and is currently possible if you created a script to read the obj file data. There is no lighting right now, which I might implemetnt if I get around to it, but don't hold your breath on that. Feel free to create your own clones of the repo and add features if that's what you would like to do. I would ask if you are makeing a clone that you credit my github account and link this repo. Otherwise enjoy! This pojectc was mostly educational but I might make a game with it if I ever develop it to a better state.
